<h1>Welcome to MT2OFX V3.5</h1>

<p>This program allows the use of Microsoft Money and other personal finance 
 software with downloaded statement files from a wide variety of banks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Text-based formats (including Comma-separated values, CSV) can be supported 
 by creating a script to parse and decipher the input file. Many formats 
 are supported in the standard installation, including generic support 
 for QIF and OFC as input formats.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The SWIFT MT940 format of statement download files is used by many banks, 
 including many in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The program works by translating the input files (in a supported text 
 format including SWIFT MT940) into OFX, OFC or QIF format. Although the 
 conversion is largely automatic, there are some ways of influencing the 
 operation in order to achieve exactly the results you require. Through 
 the <a href="Configuration/Options_Window.htm">Options Window</a> the 
 program can be configured as you wish. These parameters are held in the 
 file <a href="Configuration\INIfile_Reference\MT2OFX.INI.htm">MT2OFX.INI</a>, 
 in the same directory as the program (probably C:\Program Files\MT2OFX). 
 This file can also also be viewed and modified using any text editor program 
 such as Notepad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MT2OFX can be started with its <a href="Main_Window.htm">normal window</a>, 
 which allows you to select the input and output files and select options 
 before initiating the conversion. In addition, by associating the .STA 
 file type (or any other file type) with MT2OFX, the conversion can be 
 carried out without any intervention, using options which you have pre-selected 
 for this mode of operation. This file association is set up during installation 
 for .STA and .940. Other file types must be associated by hand through 
 Windows Explorer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a name=ProgramFlow></a>Program Flow</h4>

<p>Once the conversion operation has been initiated, operation proceeds 
 through the following stages:</p>

<p>1. If the input is coming from the Windows Clipboard, it is assumed 
 to be a text file with an unknown extension; go to step 4.</p>

<p>2. If the extension of the file has been mapped directly to a script, 
 load that script and go to step 11.</p>

<p>3. If the extension is one of the MT940 Extensions, goto step 6.</p>

<p>4. Pass the file to each of the text processing scripts in turn. If 
 a script recognises the input file as its own, go to step 11.</p>

<p>5. If no script recognises the input file, it cannot be processed.</p>

<p>6. <span style="font-style: italic;">(For MT940 files)</span> <a href="Configuration\INIfile_Reference\_BankRules__Section.htm">Identify 
 the bank</a> which issued the file</p>

<p>7. Load <a href="Configuration\INIfile_Reference\Bank-Specific_Configuration.htm">treatment 
 options</a> appropriate for this bank</p>

<p>8. Read the MT940 file, identifying Statements and Transactions</p>

<p>9. Iterate through the Statements and Transactions, deriving additional 
 information required for the output on the way, possibly using additional 
 logic in <a href="Scripting_Reference\Scripting.htm">external scripts</a>.</p>

<p>10. Go to step 12.</p>

<p>11. <span style="font-style: italic;">(For non-MT940 files)</span> Use 
 the <a href="Scripting_Reference/Scripting.htm">script</a> to read and 
 process the input file.</p>

<p>12. Perform <a href="Configuration/Payee_Mapping_Window.htm">Payee Mapping</a> 
 <span style="font-style: italic;">(from version 3.1)</span></p>

<p>13. Write the output file in OFX, OFC or QIF format.</p>

 in the standard distribution of the product, see <a href="Supporting_a_New_Bank.htm">Supporting 
 a New Bank</a>.</p>
