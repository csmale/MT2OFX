<p>MT2OFX can process data from the Windows clipboard. This can be achieved in two ways:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="p">
<p>By clicking on the button "From Clipboard" on the main window</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p>By running the program with "/clipboard" as a command-line parameter</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The contents of the clipboard are written to a temporary file. Hereafter processing continues as normal. The temporary file is removed after processing is complete.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When copying data from a web page, please be aware that the text data copied to the clipboard varies according to the browser you are using. In particular the way data in tables is formatted can vary. Mozilla FireFox separates cells by Tab characters, which makes processing convenient. Internet Explorer simply uses a space character; this makes processing a rather hit-and-miss affair as cells may legally contain spaces as well. In all cases, the processing script will have to make allowances for these differences and may not work (correctly or at all) with browsers other than the one(s) it was designed for.</p>
